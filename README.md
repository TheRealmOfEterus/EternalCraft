EternalCraft
============

The most amazing mod ever created!
What is this mod about? Well, the goal is to fulfill what other mods in minecraft miss: realism, explanation, complexity and simplicity (yes on the same page, as some mods make things that should be simple complex and things that should be complex simple). It is meant to add a whole new degree to the game, as well as being designed to work with Tekkit and use up minimal Item ID's. The first goal is realistic alloy-making and chemistry. Make your machines out of whatever you want (a wooden generator!) but remember that A) different parts = different machines (right click an Alloyed Machine Block with Bolts instead of Screws after filling in the required components will make a different machine). Also, machine have different properties depending on the parts you add, and can break.

For example, to craft a machine, first you have to make plates of any Alloy (detailed later) with Ingots and a Hammer. Then, you right click with components to make the machine do different things (like Modular Powersuits!). Machine blocks can only hold so much weight and size though! Add kinetic generators to turn spinning turbines into electricity, or electric motors and grinder cores to make an electric macerator, or hook one up to a water mill along with a Gear Set instead of using electricity! The possibilities are endless!

Alloys:
Alloys use TileEntities to get one Item to cover all possible alloys. All chemical elements can be included, each with a set of properties, and the properties of the alloy are determined from these properties, which has another property: State. Different state variables choose a different gray-scale texture to use, whilst the color of the texture is determined by the elements within and the Temperature. Liquid and Gaseous metal are available, but can only be stored in special Tanks/Pipes not using the forge liquid API (to save block ID's, similar to Thaumcraft). Anyone want a Tungsten-Steel-Uranium Machine Hull with a Titanium-Plutonium-Gold Grinder Set?

Custom Machines:
As detailed above, build your machines with the parts you want to do things you want! Ores get converted to Ore Dusts, which can be Electrolysed into Dust State pieces of the Alloy System and gems/other resources

Compatibility:
Use the Typifier and Purifier (MK I, II, III) to convert other mods Ingots/Ores into Eternalcraft Alloy System Components and back!

Logistics:
Use electricity to move items around your vast custom Eternalcraft pipe, conveyor and transposer network and customize where things go, from custom Redstone circuits using the Circuit Engraver to advanced logistics system using programmable Logistical Data tubes, which can be programmed via Redpower/Computercraft/Eternalcraft's own Computer System.

Realism:
Find herbs and plants in the wild, craft hammers to make metal tools and sharp stones, survive on your own in the nether, use Blast Furnaces to melt metal into ingot molds. Battle with Hunger, Thirst and Energy bars, and various injuries, poisons and diseases, along with spawning with random capacities and weaknesses that one can add and remove from using Medicine and Genetic Modification.

Travel and Adventure:
Travel to many dimensions using electric portals and Endric (enderman) technology, find Endric circuit boards and finish RPG style quests with a new GUI, and level up your Health, Stamina, Agility, Smithing and Crafting. Fight the Void Worms found only at level -20,000 in the Void of the End Dimension (that, to save lag, despawn when you are 200 blocks away and only spawn when you are under 100 blocks away) or mine rare meteors in the Void or Space dimensions. Go to Venus, Mars, and custom Mystcraft style galaxies that you can find, but, to make sure servers don't over lag, are RIDICULOUSLY expensive to reach.

Technical-ness:
Create Antimatter reactors, use Void Stars found in the Void to power your machines, do complex nuclear reactions to produce the rare element Technetium, make awesome fusion/fission reactors, generate power from water (or intergalactic plasma, you choose) and power your huge customisable space ships (or make a Japanese mini-car, again, you choose).

Full customization:
Minimal block ID's, extensive configuration and enough blocks to make even the greatest Tekkit player alive's blocky eyes bleed. For all players! Build huge Void Metal structures or create the most advanced space station ever, or blow stuff up with spawned-in antimatter missiles and Plasma Rays. Your choice!

Now, I know such an ambitious project will take AGES to make, but I am willing to try, and it will come out sequentially (no space stations first release :( ), but I think we can do it. Also, I did release eternalcraft 0.1, but it was terrible with only 1 extra dimension and 20 new blocks/items, so I decided to start from scratch, but with a bigger team than just me and my friend Mason.
